# Green Fork - Plant-Based Recipes for a Healthier Life üå±

<img src="assets/images/logo/new-logo.png" alt="Green Fork Logo" width="200">

## Overview

This project is the **first of four Milestone Projects** for the **Full Stack Developer** course at The Code Institute. 
Green Fork is a responsive website dedicated to sharing delicious and easy vegan recipes. My mission is to inspire and simplify plant-based cooking for everyone. The site is built using **custom HTML5, CSS3, and minimal JavaScript**, ensuring an accessible, lightweight, and responsive experience across all devices.

Here is a quick preview of how the site looks on various screen sizes:

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
The main goals of Green Fork are:
- To provide a visually appealing, structured platform where users can browse plant-based recipes.
- To ensure accessibility across all devices and browsers.
- To introduce beginners to web development using semantic HTML and responsive CSS.
- To create an experience that mimics a real-world recipe website.
- To provide clear navigation, consistent design, and engaging imagery that encourages exploration.

#### User Goals
- Discover a variety of easy and delicious vegan recipes.
- Learn the basics of plant-based cooking.
- Access quick, budget-friendly meal ideas.

#### Site Owner Goals
- Promote vegan cooking and healthy eating.
- Provide comprehensive and inspiring recipe resources.
- Build a community of plant-based cooking enthusiasts.

### User Stories
1. **New Vegan:** As a new vegan, I want simple, step-by-step recipes.  
2. **Busy Professional:** As a busy professional, I want quick meal ideas.  
3. **Budget-Conscious Cook:** As a budget-conscious cook, I want affordable ingredients.  
4. **Curious Food Lover:** As a curious food lover, I want to explore and learn more about vegan cooking.

### UX Design Rationale
My design decisions are rooted in a user-centric approach:

- **User-Focused Layout:**  
  A clean, intuitive structure ensures users quickly locate recipes and understand navigation without distraction.

- **Wireframe-Informed Structure:**  
  Early wireframes guided the placement of essential elements like the header, hero section, content areas, and footer for a smooth user journey across devices.

- **Accessibility & Readability:**  
  Clear typography, sufficient color contrast, and logical content structure enhance accessibility (including ARIA attributes and descriptive alt text).

- **Iterative Design Process:**  
  I continuously refined the layout based on user feedback and testing to improve the user experience.

## Design

### Wireframes
I began with low-fidelity wireframes to outline the responsive layout and plan the structure.  
These wireframes were created using the **Mockflow** platform. You can view all wireframes in the [wireframes folder](https://github.com/carlssonanton87/milestone-project-1/tree/main/wireframes).

### üß© Final Thoughts

This project helped me develop confidence in writing structured, semantic HTML and responsive CSS from scratch. It also gave me hands-on experience with accessibility, ARIA roles, form UX, and mobile-first design. I now feel more confident working with multi-page static sites and plan to improve this project further by introducing dynamic recipe filtering and user-generated content features in the future.
